In this Hybrid vehicular communciaiton Implementation we have:

- The implementation of the communciaiton modes.
- The implementation of two services that are used to assess the performances of the hybrid communciaiton
- The definition of two Deep reinforcement learning implementations:
    - using Python library PyTorch
    - using the C++ library libTorch

To reproduce this architecture on your OMNeT++ environement you should install: 
- SUMO
- Artery
- SimuLTE
- Python or link the C++ library as showen in the "CMAkeLists.txt" file
